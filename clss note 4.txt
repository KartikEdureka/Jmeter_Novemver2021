why?

1) 1000 user due to infra or hardware user
to simulate user load which jmeter client machine is not able to handle due to hardware limitation
2)to generate uer load from different geographies to get realistic result


pre req
1) master and slave must have same version of jmeter installed
2) master and slave must have java installed on them
